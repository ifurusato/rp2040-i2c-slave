# RP2040 I2C Slave

This provides a simple implementation for using an RP2040-based MCU as an 
I2C slave with a Raspberry Pi I2C master. It is easily modified to work 
with any RP2040 but has been developed and targeted for the Adafruit 
ItsyBitsy RP2040 with its NeoPixel as a status indicator.

This repository is largely based on the original work by TraoreMorike found at:
